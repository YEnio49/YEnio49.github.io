Hi! I am Yujing Yang, a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at the [University of Birmingham](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/), where I specialize in Spatial Economics, focusing particularly on Regional and Urban Development.  My Ph.D. work aims to uncover the interactive relationships between transportation networks and regional growth, offering insights into more sustainable and resilient urban systems.

I am particularly interested in exploring how emerging technologies, such as Machine Learning, Remote Sensing, and Geographic Information Science (GIS), can be leveraged to solve complex spatial problems. My ongoing research projects include investigating the role of multilevel road networks in urban agglomeration.

Outside of academia, I am passionate about digital painting and gaming. In my free time, I enjoy creating magazine covers and game illustrations.
