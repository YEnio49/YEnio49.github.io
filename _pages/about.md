Hi! Here is Yujing Yang, a PhD candidate in Spatial Economics at the [University of Birmingham](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/). My academic journey has taken me across continents, from earning a 1st Honour degree in Finance at the [University of Ottawa](https://www.uottawa.ca/en) to completing an MSc in International Money and Banking at the University of Birmingham. 

My research interests encompass Transportation Systems, Economic Geography, Spatial Econometrics, and the application of Machine Learning techniques to solve spatial and economic challenges.
