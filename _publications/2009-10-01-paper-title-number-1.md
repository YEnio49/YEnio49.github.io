This paper explores the role of multi-modal transportation systems, which integrate various transportation modes such as road, rail, and waterways, in enhancing regional industry production. We construct a spatial Durbin model with three matrices to capture the spatial dependences of geographical proximity and economic levels between regions. Our research suggests that the construction of multimodal transport systems should consider the local economic conditions and existing infrastructure when planning transportation investments to enhance the gains for regional industries.
