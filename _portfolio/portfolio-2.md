This portfolio illustrates an origin-destination (OD) flow analysis within the Chengdu region using random values. The analysis visualizes the connections and potential travel flows between various locations within the region, showcasing the complexity and density of the network.

### Analysis Overview
The OD flow analysis was performed to understand the spatial interactions between different points within the Chengdu region. The lines on the map represent potential routes between origins and destinations, providing insights into travel patterns and connectivity within the area.

### Key Findings
- **Flow Density**: The map shows a dense network of connections, indicating a high level of interaction between different locations within the region.
- **Spatial Distribution**: The connections are spread across the region, with certain hubs showing more concentrated flows, likely representing key areas of activity or higher traffic volumes.

### Visualization
The analysis results are visualized in the network map below, illustrating the flow lines between various points in the Chengdu region.
